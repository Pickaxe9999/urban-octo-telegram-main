# Code Refactor Starter Code
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Updates Needed
1- Review all HTML tags to make sure they are readable and semantic tags
2- reorganize the elements to make sure the html flows properly to make sense to other developers
3- update alt atributes for all images used within the webpage
4- update title element to reflect the current users page that is displayed
